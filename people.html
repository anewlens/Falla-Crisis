          <h3>Eldras Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Harbinger</h4>
          <p>The patriarch of the Airuit family first met the Reckless Raiders at the family's Red Larch smithy during the height of Elemental Cult scare. He betrayed no hint of evil as he sold them weapons, repaired their armor, even crafted
            Dorian's Mimic Blade. But one day, they vanished, leaving behind an empty shop. The Raiders thought nothing of it.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the powerful, melodramatic <strong>Harbinger</strong> revealed himself at an ancient temple. It wasn't until the Heroe's Banquet did the two identities merge into the Abyssal cult leader, orchestrating the cogs in some evil
            plan.</p>
          <p>While some mysteries remain, the Battle Bois discovered The Harbinger's demonic master in the Abyss's mirrored Castle Kosto: The Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons. </p>

          <h3>Laefra Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Sorceress</h4>
          <p>Laefra appeared to be just another smithy's wife: she took care of the children, manned the front counter when her husband was working, lended her dexterity to leather stitching and finer details on the more extravagant products.
            Unseen, unnoticed and unassuming.</p>
          <p>The Sorceress, on the other hand, was a powerful force to be reckoned with. The Reckless Raiders stumbled on her work with the Earth Plane Village, yanked from its existence to theirs. She met with the Raiders openly, almost casually
            comopared to her partner, The Harbinger. No threats, no cryptic warnings.</p>
          <p>While not seen directly, The Battle Bois have discovered the carnage of The Sorceress's power in Malrod's spawns and the summoned villages scattered about the Abyss.</p>

          <h3>Varkain Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Blind Assassin</h4>
          <p>The oldest of Eldras and Laefra, Varkain was a quiet help to his father, hammering away on an anvil. After the family disappearance, he was found on the western shores of Falla by the Forgotten Four, nearly crazed and covered by a
            locked bag. It wasn't til they were lured into the trap did they discover his true nature: an eyeless assassin with a deadly demonic form.</p>
          <p>The Battle Bois have seen first-hand his lethality at Castle Kosto where the Halfling Vola was decapitated by Varkain's sabre. Despite their escape, Varkain pursues, wielding vengeance for his sister and a mission from his father.</p>
