          <h3>Eldras Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Harbinger</h4>
          <p>The patriarch of the Airuit family first met the Reckless Raiders at the family's Red Larch smithy during the height of Elemental Cult scare. He betrayed no hint of evil as he sold them weapons, repaired their armor, even crafted
            Dorian's Mimic Blade. But one day, they vanished, leaving behind an empty shop. The Raiders thought nothing of it.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the powerful, melodramatic <strong>Harbinger</strong> revealed himself at an ancient temple. It wasn't until the Heroe's Banquet did the two identities merge into the Abyssal cult leader, orchestrating the cogs in some evil
            plan.</p>
          <p>While some mysteries remain, the Battle Bois discovered The Harbinger's demonic master in the Abyss's mirrored Castle Kosto: The Demogorgon, the Prince of Demons. </p>

          <h3>Laefra Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Sorceress</h4>
          <p>Laefra appeared to be just another smithy's wife: she took care of the children, manned the front counter when her husband was working, lended her dexterity to leather stitching and finer details on the more extravagant products.
            Unseen, unnoticed and unassuming.</p>
          <p>The Sorceress, on the other hand, was a powerful force to be reckoned with. The Reckless Raiders stumbled on her work with the Earth Plane Village, yanked from its existence to theirs. She met with the Raiders openly, almost casually
            comopared to her partner, The Harbinger. No threats, no cryptic warnings.</p>
          <p>While not seen directly, The Battle Bois have discovered the carnage of The Sorceress's power in Malrod's spawns and the summoned villages scattered about the Abyss.</p>

          <h3>Varkain Airuit</h3>
          <h4>The Blind Assassin</h4>
          <p>The oldest of Eldras and Laefra, Varkain was a quiet help to his father, hammering away on an anvil. After the family disappearance, he was found on the western shores of Falla by the Forgotten Four, nearly crazed and covered by a
            locked bag. It wasn't til they were lured into the trap did they discover his true nature: an eyeless assassin with a deadly demonic form.</p>
          <p>The Battle Bois have seen first-hand his lethality at Castle Kosto where the Halfling Vola was decapitated by Varkain's sabre. Despite their escape, Varkain pursues, wielding vengeance for his sister and a mission from his father.</p>

          <h3>Kallat</h3>
          <h4>The Acolyte</h4>
          <p>Rumors of the monsters in Falla the sewers persisted for centuries, but few considered them an actual threat. But the Troglodytes, once wild and scattered, were brought together by a shaman named Kallat, promising power from the
            Demogorgon.</p>
          <p>Armed with a mystical ruby glaive, Kallat the Acolyte began his plan. He poisoned the River Var, the Elves' sole source of water. The Elves weakend from the curse, and the King tasked Onyo to find its source. But it was too late. Kallat
            and his people struck, kidnapping the fogged elves and taking them to the Abyss.</p>
          <p>The Troglodytes' downfall was their victory. One travelled to far into the city, and the Air Genasi Volance spotted him, leading the Battle Bois into the hive. Kallat, arrogant and foolish, thought he could best them. </p>

          <h3>Malrod</h3>
          <h4>The Droclich</h4>
          <p>Once a sickly, forgettable dragon hiding in the dormant volcano near Koth, Malrod mysteriously transformed to a Dracolich and spawned dozens of identical offspring. For over a year, the dragons terrorized travellers around in the
            Brazzik Mountains and rapidly gained numbers.</p>
          <p>When the Battle Bois first saw him, The Dracolich had already cloned himself hundreds of times and taken Dwarven hostages into his volcano. As his seemingly final revenge, he and his clones caused a massive rockslide on the Koth
            Mountain, sealing the city in.</p>
          <p>But hope was not lost. The Battle Bois discovered his power came from an emerald crystal, given to him by The Sorceress from Castle Kosto. After its destruction, Malrod weakened, and the adventurers defeated him at the cost of Alfengor.</p>

          <h4>The Grey Orc</h4>
          <p>When the news of Prince Vedet's murder at the hands of "The Grey Orc" the continent turned into a manhunt across the kingdoms. The sole witness, the Tabaxi Mordecai, was brought before every potential suspect. But they were all missing
            one key feature: The Orken Royal Crest.</p>
          <p>As tensions between Collet and Orken increased, the manhunt subsided. The Colletian King Retif's wrath moved from the murderer to the city, and the identity of the killer disappeared into legend.</p>
          <p>The Battle Bois, lost in the Abyss, stumbled on The Grey Orc, Livaakt, hiding in Castle Kosto-Teho. The Demogorgon put him in charge of the massive armies of Drow collecting in the Abyss and preparing for what they called "The Merge."</p>
          <p>Backed by the Forgotten Four, the party bested The Grey Orc, but not before his warning to Orianna: The Demogorgon falls to no one. </p>
