    <h1>The Story So Far</h1>
    <section id='varningInn'>
      <h2>The Varning Inn</h2>
      <p>The Reckless Raiders (minus Dorian) reunite and add a couple more adventurers, who also were invited to the Banquet of Heroes at Castle Kosto:</p>
      <p class='inset'><strong>Michann, a Dragonborn Samurai</strong></p>
      <p class="inset"><strong>Discite, a Tiefling Warlock</strong></p>
      <p>That night Orianna noticed a figure in the woods, seconds before the inn burst into flames. The Raiders and allies escaped with the innkeeper Earnest.</p>
      <p>The figure, who identified himself as Onyo the High Wizard of Falla, threatened Earnest, calling him an evil. Earnest transformed into a demon and attacked the elf.</p>
      <p>Onyo died from his wounds and exertion, but used his dying breath to beg the adventurers to find Falla and save his people.</p>

      <h2>Castle Kosto</h2>
      <p>At the Hero's Banquet, the Reckess Raiders met a group of natives to the continents:</p>
      <p><strong>Nirvad</strong>, a Human Paladin from Collet and personal confidant of King Retif.</p>
      <p><strong>Sarquine</strong>, a Tiefling Sorceress and Royal Mage of Collet.</p>
      <p><strong>Targ</strong>, son of Hovd, heir to the throne of Orken on his return.</p>
      <p><strong>Vola</strong>, Halfling Ranger from the Glass Desert.</p>
      <p><strong>The Raiders learned of several crises in the region:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>King Retif of Collet has accused Orken of harboring the murderer of his son, “The Grey Orc.”</li>
        <li>Collet has dammed the river leading to Orken, causing a deadly drought and famine.</li>
        <li>Orken is standing strong, but there’s been rumors Collet is building up its army, possibly staging for war.</li>
        <li>The dwarves of Koth have been terrorized by a swarm of dragons, causing its trade to be stifled.</li>
        <li>The seedy merchant city of Jeshi is thriving as usual, but its leader The Receiver has grown quiet.</li>
        <li>Since the people of Falla disappeared, a brutal gang of bandits have grown in power. They are well armed, organized and merciless</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hosts of the Hero's Banquet emerge, revealing themselves to be the <strong>Airuits, the blacksmith family from Red Larch</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Eldras, the father,</strong> approaches the party, greeting them warmly, but Orianna sensed a trap and became unnerved. She demanded they leave.</p>
      <p>To ease their worries, <strong>Laefra, the mother,</strong> offered a private room for the party.</p>
      <p>That night, the party is attcked by Drow and <strong>the Airuit daughter, Reisa, </strong>now clad in black armor and wielding a warhammer.</p>
      <p>The party bested their attackers and descended the tower, finding signs of struggle in the room below.</p>
      <p>In the banquet hall, Sarquine, Targ, Nirvad and Vola battled <strong>Eldras the Harbinger</strong>, and<strong> Laefra the Sorceress.</strong></p>
      <p>The two parties manage to escape with Sarquine's teleportation circle, but not before <strong>Varkain, the Blind Assassin</strong> kills Vola with a thrown sabre.</p>
