      <h2>The Varning Inn</h2>
      <p>The Reckless Raiders (minus Dorian) reunite and add a couple more adventurers, who also were invited to the Banquet of Heroes at Castle Kosto:</p>
      <p class='inset'><strong>Michann, a Dragonborn Samurai</strong></p>
      <p class="inset"><strong>Discite, a Tiefling Warlock</strong></p>
      <p>That night Orianna noticed a figure in the woods, seconds before the inn burst into flames. The Raiders and allies escaped with the innkeeper Earnest.</p>
      <p>The figure, who identified himself as Onyo the High Wizard of Falla, threatened Earnest, calling him an evil. Earnest transformed into a demon and attacked the elf.</p>
      <p>Onyo died from his wounds and exertion, but used his dying breath to beg the adventurers to find Falla and save his people.</p>

    <section id='castleKosto'>
      <h2>Castle Kosto</h2>
      <p>At the Hero's Banquet, the Reckess Raiders met a group of natives to the continents:</p>
      <p><strong>Nirvad</strong>, a Human Paladin from Collet and personal confidant of King Retif.</p>
      <p><strong>Sarquine</strong>, a Tiefling Sorceress and Royal Mage of Collet.</p>
      <p><strong>Targ</strong>, son of Hovd, heir to the throne of Orken on his return.</p>
      <p><strong>Vola</strong>, Halfling Ranger from the Glass Desert.</p>
      <p><strong>The Raiders learned of several crises in the region:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>King Retif of Collet has accused Orken of harboring the murderer of his son, “The Grey Orc.”</li>
        <li>Collet has dammed the river leading to Orken, causing a deadly drought and famine.</li>
        <li>Orken is standing strong, but there’s been rumors Collet is building up its army, possibly staging for war.</li>
        <li>The dwarves of Koth have been terrorized by a swarm of dragons, causing its trade to be stifled.</li>
        <li>The seedy merchant city of Jeshi is thriving as usual, but its leader The Receiver has grown quiet.</li>
        <li>Since the people of Falla disappeared, a brutal gang of bandits have grown in power. They are well armed, organized and merciless</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hosts of the Hero's Banquet emerge, revealing themselves to be the <strong>Airuits, the blacksmith family from Red Larch</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Eldras, the father,</strong> approaches the party, greeting them warmly, but Orianna sensed a trap and became unnerved. She demanded they leave.</p>
      <p>To ease their worries, <strong>Laefra, the mother,</strong> offered a private room for the party.</p>
      <p>That night, the party is attcked by Drow and <strong>the Airuit daughter, Reisa, </strong>now clad in black armor and wielding a warhammer.</p>
      <p>The party bested their attackers and descended the tower, finding signs of struggle in the room below.</p>
      <p>In the banquet hall, Sarquine, Targ, Nirvad and Vola battled <strong>Eldras the Harbinger</strong>, and<strong> Laefra the Sorceress.</strong></p>
      <p>The two parties manage to escape with Sarquine's teleportation circle, but not before <strong>Varkain, the Blind Assassin</strong> kills Vola with a thrown sabre.</p>

    <section id='deadMansTower'>
      <h2>Dead Man's Tower</h2>
      <p>Sarquine took the party to <strong>Dead Man's Tower</strong>, an ancient mage haven. The survivors decide to split up to warn the kingdoms of the cult at Castle Kosto:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nirvad will return to Collet</strong> and attempt to steer King Retif from war against Orken.</li>
        <li><strong>Sarquine will search the Great Library of Falla</strong> for any answers about The Harbinger's cult or the disappearance of the Elves.</li>
        <li><strong>Targ will return to Orken</strong> to assume his father's throne, relying on Nirvad to persuade Collet from war.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Reckless Raiders, now dubbed The Battle Bois, accompnied Sarquine to Falla, hoping to find answers of the Falla disappearance, then travelling north to assist Koth.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='falla'>
      <h2>Falla</h2>
      <p>Shortly after arriving in Falla the Battle Bois discovered Dwarven elite soldiers known as <strong>Stone-Crushers</strong> have arrived in the city, led by Captain Ceannard. The regiment was also investigating the Elves' disappearance, but
        with the intention of moving the Koth population to escape the dragons.</p>
      <p>While searching the castle courtyard, the party chased a dark figure spying on them through the prison into the sewers where Troglodytes had taken residence. However, the water seemed to be enchanted, climbing the walls into the city.</p>
      <p>Following the source of water led to a gargantuan cavern, home to hundreds of Troglodytes led by a Shaman named Kallat. The Battle Bois killed the Troglodyte, causing a tidal wave to throw them out into the Pool of Sehanine.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='poolOfSehanine'>
      <h2>The Pool of Sehanine</h2>
      <p>Surviving the fall, the Battle Bois found the hut of Onyo, the High Wizard of Falla, along with his journals, in which he hypothesizes <strong>Fie the Trickster, the mastermind behind an ancient war, is behind the continent's recent
          turmoil.</strong></p>
      <p>While retrieving Kallat’s Ruby-Edged Glaive, Michann and Volance are attacked by <strong>The Blind Assassin</strong> from Castle Kosto. The two wounded the assassin, but he escaped in the dense fog.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='koth'>
      <h2>Koth</h2>
      <p>On the path to Koth, the party was attacked by a swarm of cloned dragons, led by a <strong>Dracolich named Malrod</strong>. In the attack, the city was sealed shut by a rockslide, trapping The Battle Bois and the city of Koth inside.</p>
      <p>Not wanting to sit idly by, the Battle Bois assisted the city guard investigate the murder of an esteemed armorsmith, <strong>Boneforge</strong>, discovering the old man was <strong>supplying arms to Bandits.</strong></p>
      <p>On the trail of the armorsmith's assassin, the B.B. followed a lead into Koth's hidden Thieves' Den and run into an old acquaintance <strong>Alianor, an agent of the governor of Jeshi, the Receiver</strong>. Alianor revealed the assassin:
        <strong>Dorian Calder, who is combatting the bandits headquartered north of the Vilsen Sea</strong>.</p>
      <p>While hiding Dorian’s involvement, the Battle Bois inform the Guard of Boneforge’s crimes and collect the reward.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Not wanting to wait on The Stone-Crushers, the Battle Bois offered to help <strong>King Brazzik</strong> scout the volcano. There they discovered Dwarven slaves forced to arrange gold around a glowing emerald crystal in some kind of cloning
        ritual.</p>
      <p>In a risky act of deception, the party penned a letter to Malrod posing as an admirer from Castle Kosto. The dragon is confused by the letter, trying to decipher it as a code and <strong>implying some relation to the cult at Kosto.</strong></p>
      <p>When Malrod left the volcano to obtain an explanation of The Harbinger, the BB infiltrated the dragon hive and destroyed the crystal, causing the clones to wither away. During the evacuation, <strong>Alfengor reunites with his lost brother
          Ylfengor</strong>, and Malrod returns, his power quickly draining.</p>
      <p>In the subsequent fight, <strong>Alfengor gave his life for his brother</strong>, and <strong>Michann split the dracolich in half, killing him for good</strong>. Ylfengor bottles his brother's ashes and returns to his homeland.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During their journey out of the Koth mountains, <strong>a High Elf named Pavlov snuck onto their wagon and joined the party</strong>, hoping to find his mentor by joining the Battle Bois.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='jeshi'>
      <h2>Jeshi</h2>
      <p>Upon an exploration of Jeshi's lighthouse, the Battle Bois were approached by <strong>Aramais, a member of the city's governing group, the Jeshi Council</strong>. Aramais generously lent them the ship <em>Receiver’s Whim</em> to visit the
        prison of Fie, as well as promising a meeting with another member of the Jeshi Council and to find Volance’s prison-escaped friend, Arian.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='prisonOfFie'>
      <h2>Prison of Fie</h2>
      <p>The Battle Bois found the island and broke the seal that bore five symbols: one for each kingdom of Falla, plus one they did not recognize.</p>
      <p>Four Dwarves came back to life in one of the prison’s traps. The B.B. peacefully negotiated out of combat and allowed them to take haven in their ship.</p>
      <p>They met The Wardens and an elf named Aramais who guarded the prison. These guardians seemed to have been sentenced to the prison for some past crime, <strong>revealed to them by visions of the past narrated by a mysterious voice.</strong></p>
      <p>When they entered the cell, they discovered <strong>a drow claiming to be Lolth, the goddess of Trickery</strong>. The goddess claimed <strong> she saved Fie during a faltering of the world’s magic 200 years ago, but in return Lolth was
          locked in Fie’s place.</strong></p>
      <p>Not willing to believe the imprisoned woman and not sure how to return to where they came, the BB jumped from the platform, drifting off into the multiverse.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='abyss'>
      <h2>The Abyss</h2>
      <p>The Battle Bois arrived in the Abyss and met <strong>The Forgotten Four, adventurers tasked by Onyo of Falla to seek out the growing darkness in the region.</strong>
        <p>
          <p>The Abyss had been <strong>taken over by armies of Drow</strong>, slaughtering the <strong>villages that somehow get teleported there</strong>. A citadel from Celestia alone has stood strong for weeks against the onslaught.</p>
          <p>The Ranger of the FF, a strange magical machine named <strong>Cogsworth</strong>, has detected a portal back to the Material in the ocean.</p>
          <p>The BB accompany the FF and help steal a warship from the Drow docks and sail to the citadel, commandeered by the angel <strong>Aurelia</strong>. She lends roc to get the two parties to a <strong>mirrored Castle Kosto which supposedly
              houses theportal.</strong></p>
    </section>

    <section id='castleKostoTeho'>
      <h2>Castle Kosto-Teho</h2>
      <p><strong>The Abyssal Castle Kosto</strong> was nearly identical to its Material counterpart, and the parties were greeted solely by a butler named <strong>Kasi</strong>, who escorted them down to the “master of the castle.”</p>
      <p>In a strange chamber, the parties <strong>found the missing Falla elves suspended in the air, powering a ritual performed by a Grey Orc.</strong></p>
      <p>From a dark pool in the center of the chamber, <strong>The Demogorgon, Prince of Demons</strong> rose. The demon informs the orc Livaakt that <strong>The Harbinger is preparing for The Merge, The Sorceress is working to keep Redeo unaware</strong>
        and <strong>Varkain is tracking the escapees from the banquet.</strong></p>
      <p>Livaakt admits the Drow have not been able to conquer the Celestial Citadel, so The Demogorgon decides to deal with it himself and informs the Grey Orc the party is watching before departing the Chamber.</p>
      <p>After the fierce battle, Livaakt barely escapes, and the two parties return to the Material through the pool. </p>
    </section>

    <section id='jeshiCouncil'>
      <h2>The Jeshi Council</h2>
      <p>The Battle Bois found a small rowboat which they used to flag down a boat captained by an <strong>Oggie Storm-Eyes</strong> who was headed to Jeshi with Lula-made armor and weapons. Below deck, <strong>an eccentric dracologist named Rhazien
          Orage</strong> had stowed away, having just visited the corpse of Malrod.</p>
      <p>Several hours later, the party arrived back at the <em>Receiver's Whim</em>, discovering the ancient Dwarves assassinated, save <strong>Snow-Bane</strong>, who was clinging to life. Pavlov stabilized the dwarf, and the Battle Bois made
        their way back to Jeshi for help. Once on land, they found a medical clinic that would take care of Snow-Bane.</p>
      <p>Returning to the lighthouse, the party ran into <strong>Aramais</strong>, who fulfilled his promise in setting up a meeting with another member of the Jeshi Council. On the top floor of the base of the lighthouse, they met <strong>Tavion, a
          curt Blue Dragonborn woman.</strong> Tavion was irritated at the hour of the meeting, and accosted Pavlov for lacking real purpose for this meeting.</p>
      <p>Volance, however, got the answer he was looking for. Tavion explained <strong>the Receiver needed retribution for Volance's pirating</strong> the past three years, and <strong>Volance's mentor Arian was being held until payment was made.</strong>
        She instructed them to go to Collet, and wait
        for instructions there.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='Collet'>
      <h2>The Jeshi Council</h2>
      <p>The Battle Bois hitched a ride to Collet with associates of Rhazien Orage and made it to Collet, where they were soon greeted by a royal liaison by the name of <strong>Silvain Montgomery</strong>. Silvain said <strong>King Retif</strong> wanted to honor them to for slaying the dragon Malrod, so they would be given the villa Chateau Relev and be esteemed guests at <strong>Tournesol</strong>, the festival of the sun the following night. </p>

      <p>At the Chateau, Pavlov, Orianna, Volance and Discite are lured away by a strange navy cat to a navy boat at the merchant docks. Below deck, three figures identifying themselves as <strong>Mourn-hell</strong>, a bald black human missing his right ear, <strong>Mist-splitter</strong>, a large darker skinned human, and Alianor. Mourn-hell and Mist-splitter had taken faceless potions so they could not be recognized. Mourn-hell alone spoke, requesting help dethroning the king by any means necessary. Factions in the kingdom see an unjust war coming and don't see Retif softening any time soon. The Battle Bois accept.</p>

      <p>During the meeting, Michann and Lailius stumbled into The Temple of Pelor, where they found a fighting ring involving child slaves. The dragonborn recognied a slaver and tried to break up the ring, but instead sparked a spar between a guard and Lailius, who won handily.</p>

      <p>At Tournesol, the party meets <strong>King Retif</strong> and <strong>Queen Arriere</strong>, the former having enlisted a <strong>General Tronde</strong> to fight various soldiers for sport. Retif "suggests" Michann duel Tronde in the pit, roping Volance into a bet of several thousand gold and the child slaves being sparred in the Temple of Pelor.</p>

      <p>Michann wins the duel, but Retif insists to keep it sporting and have the victor execute the general. After several protests and whispers from the queen, Retif called it off and posed the request as a joke. He invited the party for brunch the next morning.</p>

      <p>After the festival, Tronde introduced himself to the party, revealing himself as Mourn-Hell. Another attendee, a Aasimar by the name of <strong>Mar</strong>, identified himself as Mist-Splitter.</p>

      <p>On the boat ride back, the party was attacked by slavers attempting to kidnap Michann, but the attackers were unsuccessful.</p>
