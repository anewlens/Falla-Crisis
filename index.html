    <p>Test After their battles against the Elemental Cults in the Dessarin Valley, the Reckless Raiders went their separate ways, continuing on their own personal quests or seeking a greater purpose. Unbeknownst to them, a great darkness seeped
      into the
      ancient Fälla Continent in the Western Sea. Its bright metropolis was taken, its 25,000 Elves mysteriously vanishing overnight. Now, no one dares set foot in the once teeming city of magic.
    </p>
    <p>With the largest city in the region gone and its role of mediator between the kingdoms missing, diplomacy and trade have crumbled. Since the unsolved murder of his son, King Retif in Collet has lashed out towards their southern neighbor,
      Orken, by damming their shared river, cutting off the desert city’s sole water supply. The Koth Dwarves in the north raised a defense against a clan of dragons, thought to be hibernating deep in the Brazzik Mountains. Their call for help has
      gone unanswered. Even the ever teeming merchant settlement of Jeshi seems lost in the the crisis. Their control of the darker corners of the land has been loosened, their hidden leader, The Receiver, silent.
    </p>
    <p>Now, after two years on their own, each of the Reckless Raiders receives an invitation. A banquet in honor of the defenders of the lands is being held at Castle Kosto, a mystery on the west coast of the tumultuous continent. So by chance or
      by fate, the Tiefling, Genasi, Dwarf and Wood Elf join a newcomer at the Varning Inn on a quiet, starry night…
