      <h2>Alfengor</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Dwarf Cleric</em></p>
      <p>Alfengor first joined the Reckless Raiders as a means to search for his brother, Ylfengor, following the death of their father. Blessed by the Dwarven godessHe accomplished his mission, but only mere minutes before he gave his life in the
        Battle of the Dracolich. His
        ashes will be returned to his homeland.</p>

    <section id="discite">
      <h2>Discite</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Tiefling Warlock</em></p>
      <p>Not much is known about the inquisitive Tiefling who joined the Battle Bois at their first meeting at the Varning Inn. She keeps her Archfey patron a secret, never revealing her mission.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="lailius">
      <h2>Lailius</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Tiefling Barbarian</em></p>
      <p>Not all Clerics keep their oath, and Lailius gave his up in his journey back to Hades, his home. Not much is known of the time between the Elemental Cult attacks and the reunion at the Varning Inn, but it was obviously a transformative time
        for the Tiefling, arriving clothed only in a loincloth, a maul on his back.</p>

    <section id="michann">
      <h2>Michann</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Dragonborn Samurai</em></p>
      <p>Michann drifted to Falla in pursuit of a better life, leaving behind her slavery in the gladiator ring. While an esteemed warrior and master of the glaive, the Dragonborn's homeland in the Spine of the World was insulated from the magic of
        the south, and Michann's adventures have rocked her reality and left her with questions.</p>

    <section id="orianna">
      <h2>Orianna</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Half-Elf Druid</em></p>
      <p>The bold Druid Orianna resisted a permanent union with the roudy and reckless adventurers, preferring the company of her direwolf Brahmin instead. But paths crossed and intertwined and bonds were formed, and soon Orianna and Brahmin
        accompanied the Raiders more often than not. Now as a member of the Battle Bois, Orianna is a protective and headstrong voice in the group.</p>

    <section id="pavlov">
      <h2>Pavlov</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>High Elf Cleric</em></p>
      <p>The soft-spoken, yet wildly bold elf Pavlov first met the Battle Bois when Alfengor and Lailius invaded his hotel room. Following the Battle of the Dracolich, the cleric joined the party hoping their adventures would aid him on his quest to
        find a person from his past.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="volance">
      <h2>Volance</h2>
      <p class="subtitle"><em>Air Genasi Swashbuckler</em></p>
      <p>For being an expert in finesse, the blue skinned genasi has remained the most static member of the Battle Bois, hoarding every pit of gold to buy back his mentor's freedom. In Falla, old mistakes are rising up around him, but he stays
        looking forward.</p>
